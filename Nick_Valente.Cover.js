  I've been diving into the CyberPeace tech stack and you're using everything I've learned so far: ${techStack.join( ", " )} and having a blast with libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap. My projects? They're usually a bit front-end heavy because, honestly, I find designing stuff more exciting at the moment. But don't be fooled â€“ I'm diving into server-side stuff too and have written a few RESTful APIs âœ….

  I used to own an electrical business, but I decided to switch gears and let my creative and problem-solving side take over. That's the fun part of work, right? Now, I'm just looking for that foot in the door ðŸš€

  And even if I'm not the perfect fit for this role, I'd still love to hear back from you. So, to sum myself up: I use AGILE, my projects are all on GitHub, I live super close to Geneva, and I'm a nice guy!

  Hope this application stands out in the best way possible!

  Cheers,
  ${applicantName}`);
