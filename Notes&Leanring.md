# Notes & Leanring

### Classic Nick - 
Forgot to import the CSS Tailwind styles into the ```main.tsx``` ...again. No wonder it took ages.
- Ran through the Tailwind Docs to find this issue and also compared to previous project

## Use an interface plus array (variable) to create the Navbar


## Use standard method to create the footer (no array/interface)


## Retrieve Project Data in the ProjectsPage and render the specific data of a selected project
- Ok, so this took time. ⌛️
- Rather than learn a new and conmplex method (context / state management library)
    - Simple conditionally render the selected project with it's data on the page from a TSX component.
    - Don't use a <Link/> tag, because you have to pass props and data through it ❌
