An app commissioned for an Electrical Engineering Company based between France and Switzerland.

I origionally intended to have an Object-orientated programming approach, but I had to switch early on due to lack of practice in linking the Front-end to the Back-end. After reading about it, I've gone with a functional approach, whcih is to say the software is structured in a series of linear functions determined by the function calls.

Every decision tha I make, I always try to zoom out and consider the architeture and design of what I'm building. so, although I make a switch this time - I've still had plenty of eureka moments!
